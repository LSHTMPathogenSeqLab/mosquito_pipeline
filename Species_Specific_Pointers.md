Different mosquitoes have different numbers of chromosomes and these are named differently. 

You can see these on NCBI for the relevant mosquito reference genome:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/

Anopheles gambiae AgamP3: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000005575.2/

Anopheles gambaie AgamP4: https://metazoa.ensembl.org/Anopheles_gambiae/Info/Index

Note that the Anopheles gambiae reference genomes have been generated from a combo of coluzzii and gambiae s.s., so handily they contain regions unique to coluzzii too. This is useful when differentiating species with SINE200X6.1 (see associated scripts). 

AgamP4 differs from AgamP3 as it has the mitochondrial genome added.

Anopheles coluzzii: AcolN3 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_943734685.1/

Anopheles darlingi: AnoDarlMG_H_01: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_943734745.1/

Anopheles melas: Anop_mela_CM1001059_A_v2: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_000473525.2/Note the melas reference genome is a scaffold-level assembly with 20,229 scaffolds and no assembled chromosomes. For my analysis I have aligned to the AgamP4 reference genome instead of melas reference genome because of this.
